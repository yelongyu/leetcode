"""
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s
elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to
its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]

Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number
for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the
second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for
it in the second array, so output -1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]

Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it
in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater
number for it in the second array, so output -1.

Note:
    All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
    The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.


[one more step]:

    you should figure out what is the next greater number first, or you can
not do it right.

for example:
    Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].

    init result = []

    1. the first element in list num1 is 2, so we need find 2 in list num2
first, then we found it's index in num2 is 1, next we should find a number
bigger than 2 in nums2[1:], we found 3 is bigger than 2! result = [3].

    2. the second number in list nums1 is 4, we found that the index of 4 in
list nums2 is 3, and also it's the last element in nums2, so, there is no more
number can be bigger than 4, we add -1 to the result.


    3. finally: Output: [3,-1]
